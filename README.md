LANDSLIDE PREDICTION USING ENSEMBLE MACHINE LEARNING MODEL

OBJECTIVES
1.	Accurate Landslide Prediction: Develop a robust machine learning-based ensemble model combining Random Forest (RF), XGBoost, and Gradient Boosting through a Voting Classifier to classify conditions as Stable or Landslide with high precision.
2.	Real-Time Monitoring: Implement a Streamlit-based web application to enable real-time data input, providing users with live monitoring and prediction capabilities.
3.	Enhanced Model Performance: Optimize model accuracy by applying hyperparameter tuning to improve classification efficiency.

ABSTRACT
Landslides are a significant geohazard, posing threats to human life, infrastructure, and the environment. This study introduces a machine learning-based landslide prediction system capable of classifying conditions into two categories: Stable (0) and Landslide (1). The system processes real-time sensor data, including rainfall intensity, soil moisture levels, and ground vibrations, through an ensemble machine learning framework. The model integrates Random Forest (RF), XGBoost, and Gradient Boosting using a Voting Classifier, leveraging the strengths of each algorithm for improved accuracy and reliability in landslide prediction. A user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit enables real-time monitoring, data visualization, and prediction results. Additionally, hyperparameter tuning is applied to optimize model performance. Rigorous testing across various environmental scenarios demonstrates the systemâ€™s effectiveness in distinguishing between stable and landslide-prone conditions. This scalable and data-driven solution enhances early warning systems, providing a valuable tool for disaster management agencies to improve safety and preparedness in vulnerable regions.
